# [Project title]

This repo is course plan documenting a maker-oriented Introduction to Programming course at Georgia Tech CS-6452. This class was offered to graduate students from the Masters and PhD program but it can be taught at an udergraduate level too.
This class was offered over the course of Fall semester and taught two major modules: Introduction to Physical Computing and Introduction to Mobile Phone Programming.
This repo focuses purely on the firs module i.e. Intro to Physical Computing.
It contains guidelines that should not be followed exactly. Some of the exercises require use of resources on the Georgia Tech campus. But educators are encouraged to find alternative resources in their community ortweak exercises such that they use readily available resources.
For eg. there may be sessions where we use a 3-D printer to prototype a case for a prototype but that can substituted by a manual exercise such as forming a cardboard box case.
Each module should be tailored to the individual class.
It is written by and for education innovators.
Insert credits to gregory and team here.

## What is a course plan?
A course plan gives you a schedule of what content to teach in class and methods that hve been successfully used to impart it.
This course plan captures the activities followed by the Georiga Tech Instructional team in class and outside of class to get students to tinker with Arduinos and such.

The course has been pioneered by the following team at Georgia Tech:
Grgory Abowd
Aman Parnami
Elizabeth DiSalvo
Zane Cochran
[Google Ventures Design
Team](http://www.designstaff.org/articles/product-design-sprint-2012-10-02.html).

#### Why do a course plan this way?

This Rapid Prototyping course plan was made by Manasvi because [RQ/problem statement from paper]. Manasvi spent time taking the class as well as later acting as a Tteaching assistant for the class and spent time documenting and creating content for this course plan as repository for the community.

A design sprint orients the team
and aims our efforts toward a mutual goal.
Design thinking and product design sprints
keep us on target
and invest our time and money wisely.

Sprints are useful when kicking off a new
business, product, feature, or workflow.
Sprints can also be used to solve problems with an existing product.

#### What should you expect to have at the end of reading/using this course plan?

At the end of the sprint,
the team will understand the problem and
will have validated
whether we have a viable solution to begin building
or whether we need to run another sprint to keep searching for a solution.

## Design Sprint Overview

A design sprint is comprised of five phases;
Understand, Diverge, Converge, Prototype and Test.
Each phase typically lasts one day.

#### [Pre-Sprint](0-Pre-Sprint)

We should not start a sprint
without defining a "job to be done"
as the focus of the sprint.
The "job to be done" may evolve during the sprint
into a problem statement agreed upon by the whole team,
but without one as a starting point
our client is not ready and should not be paying us.

#### [Understand Phase](1-Understand)

The Understand phase
develops a common understanding
of the context within which we are working
and all the elements in that context:
the customer,
their job to be done,
and the business our client hopes to support by servicing the job to be done.
We want to expose risky knowledge gaps and assumptions
so we can make plans to reduce those risks
and move forward with confidence.

#### [Diverge Phase](2-Diverge)

The Diverge phase
generates insights and concepts for solutions.
Our goal is to explore as many possibilities as possible,
regardless of how feasible or viable.
Insights are born from this explosion of possibilities
by considering the implications of
radically different approaches to solving a problem.
These insights can become
valuable differentiating forces
and the source of
inspiration for unique solutions.

#### [Converge Phase](3-Converge)

The Converge phase
takes all the possibilities generated over the past two phases
and hones in on a single version
to prototype
and test with existing or potential customers.
By exploring and eliminating so many options,
we have reason to be more confident in our choices.

#### [Prototype Phase](4-Prototype)

The Prototype phase
develops a prototype
that fills our riskiest knowledge gaps and assumptions.
Paper prototypes,
Keynote prototypes,
Flinto prototypes,
and
static HTML/CSS pages
are all valid mediums.
The medium
should be determined by
our time constraints
and learning goals.

#### [Test Phase](5-Test)

The Test phase
tests our prototype
with existing or potential customers.
By the end of this phase,
we should have validated or invalidated
our riskiest knowledge gaps and assumptions
and have confidence in our next steps.

## [Design Sprint Trello Template](https://trello.com/b/lMmuSlkP/public-design-sprint-template)

Throughout the sprint you want to be recording as much as possible.
We've found Trello to be an excellent tool to help the team record the activities
taken during the sprint. This template helps alleviate some of the initial setup
for the board and leaves references to this repo.

Copy [this template](https://trello.com/b/lMmuSlkP/public-design-sprint-template)
to your own board to help guide and document your sprint.
